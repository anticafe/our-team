hi Nimbl3 team!

My name is Jakub Niewczas and when I found your job offer, I instantly thought that this is something really really interesting. I am professional Ruby On Rails developer with 2.5+ years experience working on big Rails projects. I also work as a freelancer Rails programmer on smaller projects to test new ideas, sharpen my skills and have fun in general.

In my current work I am iOS developer which is my second specialization. I believe knowing, understanding and being able to code on especially those two platforms is really powerful skill combination.

I studied for 3 years Computer Science at Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology and finished it with Engineer's Degree.

Working in smaller softwarehouse, on technologies I love, in Thailand is just a dream job.

Please take a look at my website which is my digital CV: [http://www.jakubniewczas.pl/](http://www.jakubniewczas.pl/).

I'm looking forward to connecting,

Jakub Niewczas
