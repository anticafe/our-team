Nimbl3 is a software development company focused on building products for startups. We strive on building world-class web and mobile applications for our clients which are recognised startups and backed by prominent VCs and investors such as 500 startups, DeNA, InTouch, Alibaba.com investors. 

Nimbl3 is founded by software developers who have been part of the early stage team of recognized companies such as Lazada (Rocket Internet). We are a 100% engineering company with a strong product management focus. 

At Nimbl3, we believe in self-driven attitude and passion to learn new technologies. All developers are trained to be full-stack software engineers covering both web and mobile platforms.

**Project Planning**

**Communication**
* We have worked with in-house and remote teams, and we have reached to the conclusion that our iterations are way faster when we are at the same office. It's also nice to talk about issues openly with your colleagues face to face, Skype calls with multiple people can be chaotic (remember when someone said i can't hear you?) and non-productive.
* Hipchat. All the repositories and deployment activities are notified to specific rooms allowing us to track who is doing what. We believe in transparency so our clients and us are on the same page anytime.
* Email. There are some tools to build around it to manage it better (e.g. several emails coming from repo activities could be unnoticed)

**For deployment**
* Mina for deployments
* Digital Ocean/AWS/Heroku(sometimes) mainly as the projects we have done required low level adjustement. Heroku is not always a possibility.
* Some githooks for specific tasks like updating i18n files.
