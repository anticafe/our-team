We serve startups from Asia Pacific Region and we run our company as a startup as well. We like to work with flexible, fun and smart people.

**Kind of projects we have done / do**
* Several eCommerce platforms from the ground up
* Live video streaming and on demand video rendering
* Payments
* Traditional transactional web and mobile apps.

**Kind of consulting we do**
* Performance improvement.
* Scalability consulting (e.g. to help you to handle TV commercial kind of traffic).
* Architecture.
* Security and basic penetration testing.

**For development**
* MacOS machines to avoid spending one day every 6 months formatting a machine
* Rubymine
* Sublime text
* PHP Storm
* Vagrant and exploring Docker to avoid "it works on my machine" pointing fingers.


**Project Planning**
*  Pivotal tracker
*  Asana for non code related activities
*  Invision
*  Proto.io

**Communication**
* We have worked with in-house and remote teams, and we have reached to the conclusion that our iterations are way faster when we are at the same office. It's also nice to talk about issues openly with your colleagues face to face, Skype calls with multiple people can be chaotic (remember when someone said i can't hear you?) and non-productive.
* Hipchat. All the repositories and deployment activities are notified to specific rooms allowing us to track who is doing what. We believe in transparency so our clients and us are on the same page anytime.
* Email. There are some tools to build around it to manage it better (e.g. several emails coming from repo activities could be unnoticed)

**For deployment**
* Mina for deployments and migrating to Capistrano as it already supports multiple commands over the same SSH connection
* Heroku mainly for staging environments as the projects we have done required low level adjustements, so heroku is not always a possibility.
* Some githooks for specific tasks like updating i18n files.
* Exploring codeship.io and drone.io 

**Monitoring**
* New Relic
* Icinga
* Munin
* Exploring airbrake at the moment.
